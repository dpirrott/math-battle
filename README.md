# Mental-Math-Battle

A competitive math app created just for fun (for my brother and I at least). The main reason why I've been developing this app is so I can get familiar with websockets using SocketIO.

So far the app is a work in progress. I'll be including installation instructions here once the app feels ready for the public (as well as a live demo site of course).

Still a long ways to go...
